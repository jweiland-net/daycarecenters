   You need to configure the extension maps2 first! Check out the `maps2 documentation <https://docs.typo3.org/p/jweiland/maps2/master/en-us/Configuration/Index.html>`_.

Open the Extension Configuration inside the Configuration module and set a default page (or storage folder) for all poi collection records (created using a maps2 hook)
and a default maps2 category. This category will be used for all maps2 record that has been generated using a maps2 hook while saving a kita record.
