Welcome to the Daycare Center Management Extension!

This TYPO3 extension provides a user-friendly solution for showcasing and
managing daycare center information directly in the frontend. Designed with
parents and guardians in mind, it simplifies the process of finding suitable
daycare options by offering advanced filtering capabilities.

Users can easily search for daycare centers based on multiple criteria,
including:

- **District**: Locate centers in a specific geographic area.
- **Age of Admission**: Find centers that accept children of a certain age group.
- **Opening Hours**: Filter based on operating times that suit your schedule.
- **Meal Availability**: Check whether meals are offered by the center.

Whether you're a parent looking for the best childcare option or an admin
managing a growing list of centers, this extension ensures a seamless and
intuitive experience.
